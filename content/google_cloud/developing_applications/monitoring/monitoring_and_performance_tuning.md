Monitoring is the foundation of application reliability. With Cloud Monitoring, you can build custom dashboards and use out-of-the-box dashboards to answer basic questions about your application. You should create application dashboards that include the four golden signals: Latency, traffic, errors, and saturation.
- Latency is the amount of time that it takes to serve a request. Make sure to distinguish between the latency of successful and unsuccessful requests.
- Traffic is a measure of how much demand is placed on your system.
- Errors indicate the number of failed requests.
- Saturation indicates how full your application is, or what resources are being stretched and reaching target capacity.
