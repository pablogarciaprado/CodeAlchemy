# Random Concepts

## Bootstrap
Refers to the initial process of setting up an application or system when it starts. Specifically, it refers to the time and resources required for the application to load and become fully operational after it is triggered or launched. This process can include tasks like loading dependencies, initializing configurations, connecting to databases, and preparing the application to handle requests.

To mitigate the impact of long startup times (especially in serverless or cloud environments), you can pre-warm instances, meaning that the application is kept alive and ready to handle traffic without having to go through the bootstrap process every time a new request is made. This helps reduce the delay that could occur when an instance is started from scratch (often referred to as cold start).
