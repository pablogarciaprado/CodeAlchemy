# **Code Alchemy**

Welcome to **Code Alchemy**! This repository is a curated collection of essential notes and guides that I, a passionate data scientist with an insatiable appetite for learning, have compiled over time. As someone who enjoys programming and strives to stay organized, I created this archive to display some of the most useful notes and resources that have helped me in my journey.

The purpose of this project is to serve as a comprehensive reference for various topics related to data science, programming, and essential tools. Whether you're looking to brush up on command-line essentials, get a quick refresher on Git commands, or dive into Python programming, you'll find valuable information here.

Feel free to explore the different sections and make use of the resources provided. I hope you find this repository as helpful as I do in navigating the ever-evolving landscape of technology and data science.
